As a text-based AI, I cannot directly design a website layout in a visual manner, but I can provide you with a structured HTML and CSS code that outlines a basic website layout and theme. Below is a simple example of a responsive website layout with a clean theme using HTML and CSS.


### Summary:

The provided code represents a basic website structure with a header, navigation menu, content section, and footer. The theme is clean and professional, using a color palette of dark grey (`#333`) for the header and footer, a highlight color (`#e9ff70`) for the current navigation item, and a calming green (`#6ab47b`) for the border under the header. The layout is responsive, with a container class that centers the content and applies a width of 80% of the viewport, allowing for some margin on the sides.

### Reasoning:

The approach taken was to create a simple and adaptable website layout that can serve as a starting point for further customization. The design is minimalistic to avoid distractions and focus on content delivery. The use of a responsive container ensures that the website will look good on different devices, which is essential for modern web design. The color scheme is chosen to be neutral with a touch of color to keep the design interesting but not overwhelming.
