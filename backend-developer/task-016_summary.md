To create a User model, I'll need to know which programming language and framework you're using, as the implementation can vary significantly. However, I'll provide an example using Python with the Django framework, which is commonly used for backend development.

Here's a basic Django User model:


In this example, I've extended Django's built-in `AbstractUser` class to include additional fields such as `phone_number` and `address`. This allows for the use of Django's authentication system while also providing the flexibility to add custom fields and methods.

Summary:
- The User model extends Django's `AbstractUser`.
- Additional fields like `phone_number` and `address` are added.
- A method `get_full_name` is included to return the user's full name.

JSON Checklist for the User model creation:


The reasoning for this approach is to leverage Django's built-in user authentication system while providing the flexibility to customize the User model according to the project's requirements. The JSON checklist outlines the steps taken and reminds you to run migrations, which is necessary to apply the model changes to the database.
