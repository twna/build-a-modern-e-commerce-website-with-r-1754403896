To initialize a Node.js server with Express, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init` or `npm init -y` for default settings.
3. Install Express using `npm install express`.
4. Create a new file for your server, commonly named `app.js` or `server.js`.
5. Write the code to set up the Express server in this file.

Here is the code to set up a basic Express server:


### Summary

The code above does the following:

- Imports the `express` module.
- Creates an instance of an Express application.
- Sets the port number to either the environment's provided port or 3000 if none is provided.
- Defines a route handler for the root path (`/`) that sends a "Hello World!" response.
- Starts the server listening on the specified port and logs a message to the console when the server is running.

### Reasoning

The approach taken is standard for setting up a basic Express server. It involves initializing the project with npm to manage dependencies, installing Express as the web server framework, and writing the minimal code required to start a server that listens for HTTP requests. The server is configured to respond to the root URL with a simple message, which is a common practice for verifying that the server is running correctly. The JSON checklist provides a step-by-step confirmation that the necessary tasks to initialize the server have been completed.
