To set up middleware for parsing JSON and handling CORS in a Node.js application using Express, you would typically use the `express.json()` middleware for parsing JSON and the `cors` package to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Below is an example of how you can set up these middlewares in your Express application:


**Summary:**

1. We import the required modules: `express` for the server and `cors` for handling CORS.
2. We create an instance of an Express application.
3. We use `app.use(express.json())` to add middleware that will parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.
4. We use `app.use(cors())` to add middleware that enables CORS with various options. By default, it will allow all origins. If you need to configure specific options for CORS, you can pass an options object to the `cors()` function.
5. We set the application to listen on a specified port.

**Reasoning:**

- Using `express.json()` middleware is the standard way to parse JSON payloads in Express applications, as it is built into Express and does not require additional packages.
- The `cors` package is a widely-used and well-maintained library for handling CORS in Node.js applications. It is simple to use and can be easily configured for more complex CORS scenarios if needed.
- The use of `app.use()` to apply middleware is the conventional approach in Express, as it applies the middleware to all incoming requests.
- The JSON checklist provides a clear set of tasks that have been completed in the code, which can be useful for tracking progress or for documentation purposes.
