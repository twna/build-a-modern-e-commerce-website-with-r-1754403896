To integrate the frontend with the backend API for user authentication, you typically need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a form for users to input their credentials (username/email and password).
2. Capture the form data and send it to the backend API endpoint responsible for authentication.
3. Handle the response from the backend, which usually includes a token if authentication is successful.
4. Store the token securely in the frontend application (e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies).
5. Use the stored token to make authenticated requests to other protected backend endpoints.

Here's an example of how you might code this in a modern JavaScript frontend application using fetch API for the HTTP requests:


In the HTML, you would have a form like this:


**Summary:**
The provided JavaScript code captures the user's login credentials and sends them to the backend API using a POST request. If the login is successful, the token received from the backend is stored in `localStorage`, and the user is redirected to a dashboard page. If the login fails, an error message is displayed.

**Reasoning:**
The approach uses the `fetch` API to communicate with the backend because it is a modern, promise-based mechanism to make HTTP requests in the browser. Storing the token in `localStorage` is a common practice, although the exact storage mechanism may vary depending on the application's security requirements. The form submission is handled asynchronously to provide a better user experience and to allow for the use of `async/await` for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.
