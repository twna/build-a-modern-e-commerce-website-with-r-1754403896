To integrate the frontend with a backend API for product listing, you will typically need to perform an HTTP GET request to the backend endpoint that provides the product data. Below is an example of how you might do this using JavaScript with the Fetch API. This example assumes that your backend API has an endpoint at `/api/products` that returns a list of products in JSON format.


In the HTML, you would have a container where the products will be displayed:


### Summary:

The JavaScript code above does the following:

1. Adds an event listener for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before attempting to fetch products.
2. Defines a `fetchProducts` function that uses the Fetch API to make a GET request to the `/api/products` endpoint.
3. Checks if the response is successful (status code 200-299). If not, it throws an error.
4. Parses the response as JSON and passes the data to the `renderProducts` function.
5. Defines a `renderProducts` function that takes an array of products and creates HTML elements to display each product's information.
6. Clears any existing content in the `products-container` and appends the new product elements to it.

### Reasoning:

This approach uses the Fetch API, which is a modern, promise-based mechanism to make HTTP requests in the browser. It's widely supported and allows for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code compared to older methods like `XMLHttpRequest`. The code is structured to separate concerns: fetching data and rendering UI, which makes it more maintainable and testable. Error handling is included to provide better debugging information if the fetch operation fails.
