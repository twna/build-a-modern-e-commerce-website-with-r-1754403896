To create a Shopping Cart component, I'll assume we're using React for this example. Below is a simple Shopping Cart component that displays a list of items that a user has added to their cart. It includes the item name, price, and quantity, as well as a total cost calculation at the bottom. It also includes functionality to remove items from the cart.


### Summary:

The `ShoppingCart` component is a React class component that maintains its own state, which includes an array of `cartItems`. Each item in the cart has an `id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. The component has a method `removeItemFromCart` that filters out the item to be removed by its `id`. The `calculateTotal` method computes the total cost of the items in the cart. The `render` method outputs the list of cart items and the total cost. Each item has a "Remove" button that, when clicked, will remove the item from the cart.

### Reasoning:

I used a class component for this example because it's a common pattern and it's easy to understand state management within it. The `removeItemFromCart` and `calculateTotal` methods are straightforward and demonstrate how to manipulate and use the component's state. The component is self-contained and could be enhanced to integrate with a global state management solution like Redux or Context API, or to fetch data from a backend service.
