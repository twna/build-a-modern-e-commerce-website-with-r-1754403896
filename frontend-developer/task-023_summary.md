To integrate the frontend with the backend API for order processing, you would typically use JavaScript (or TypeScript) along with a library or framework such as React, Angular, Vue.js, etc. For this example, I'll use vanilla JavaScript with the Fetch API to demonstrate how you might handle this integration.

Here's a sample code snippet that sends an order to the backend API using a POST request:


**Summary:**
The provided JavaScript function `processOrder` takes an `orderData` object as an argument, which should contain all the necessary information about the order. It sends this data to the backend API endpoint using a POST request with the Fetch API. The `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` to indicate that the request body format is JSON. If the request is successful, it logs and returns the response data. If there's an error, it logs the error to the console.

**Reasoning:**
The Fetch API is a modern, promise-based mechanism to make asynchronous HTTP requests in the browser, which is suitable for integrating the frontend with a backend API. The use of `async/await` syntax allows for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code. Error handling is important to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the API call, such as network errors or non-2xx HTTP response codes. The checklist provides a step-by-step confirmation of the tasks completed and what remains to be done (e.g., testing the integration with example order data).
