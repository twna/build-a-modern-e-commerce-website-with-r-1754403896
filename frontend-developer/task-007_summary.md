To create a Product Detail component, I will assume we're using React for this example. The component will display individual product details such as the product image, name, description, price, and a button to add the product to a shopping cart.

Here's a simple React component for a Product Detail page:


In this component, we are expecting a `product` prop to be passed in, which contains the product details. We display a loading message until the product data is available. We then render the product's image, name, description, and price. We also include a button for adding the product to a shopping cart.

Here's a plain-text summary of the component:

- The `ProductDetail` component takes a `product` object as a prop.
- It renders an image, name, description, and price of the product.
- It includes a button to add the product to a shopping cart.
- If the `product` prop is not provided, it displays a loading message.

Finally, here's a JSON checklist for the features of the Product Detail component:


The reasoning behind this approach is to create a simple and reusable component that can be used to display the details of any product. The component is designed to handle the loading state and display the necessary product information in a user-friendly manner. The `toFixed(2)` method is used to format the price to two decimal places. The component is styled with class names, which can be defined in a separate CSS file to style the component as needed.
