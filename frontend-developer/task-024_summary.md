Since you've asked for state management using either Redux or Context API, I'll provide an example of how to implement a simple counter using both Redux and Context API in React. This will give you a clear understanding of how to manage state using both methods.

### Redux Implementation

First, let's start with Redux:

1. Install Redux and React-Redux:


2. Create the Redux store:


3. Provide the store to your React application:


4. Connect the React component to the Redux store:


### Context API Implementation

Now, let's look at the Context API:

1. Create a context and a provider component:


2. Wrap your application with the provider:


3. Use the context in your component:


### Summary

In the Redux example, we created a store with a reducer to manage the state of a counter. We then connected a React component to the store using `useSelector` to access the state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.

In the Context API example, we created a context with a provider that holds the state and functions to update it. We then used the `useContext` hook in our component to access the context values and update the state.

### JSON Checklist


The approach for each method was chosen to provide a clear and concise example of state management. Redux is more suitable for larger applications with complex state interactions, while the Context API is great for simpler state management or when passing data through a component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
