To create a Navbar component for a website header, I'll assume we're using React and a styling solution like CSS modules for this example. Below is a simple Navbar component with some navigation links. You can expand upon this with additional styling, responsive design, and interactivity as needed.



Summary:
The `Navbar` component is a functional React component that renders a navigation bar with a logo and a list of navigation links. The `styles` object is imported from a CSS module, which provides scoped class names to avoid styling conflicts. The navigation links are currently using `href` attributes with simple paths, which you can replace with routing logic if you're using a library like React Router.

Reasoning:
The approach taken here is to create a simple and reusable Navbar component that can be easily integrated into a React application. The use of CSS modules allows for component-scoped styling, which helps maintain a clean and maintainable codebase. The navigation links are placeholders and should be integrated with a routing system to enable SPA (Single Page Application) navigation without full page reloads. The checklist includes items for further development, such as making the Navbar responsive and implementing routing.
