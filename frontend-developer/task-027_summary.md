To implement responsive design using CSS, you can use media queries to apply different styles depending on the screen size of the device. Below is an example of how you might write CSS to make a simple layout responsive. This example does not use a CSS framework; it's plain CSS.


### Summary:

The CSS above defines a simple layout with a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer. The `.container` class centers the content and gives it a max width of 80%. The `.main-content` and `.sidebar` are floated next to each other, taking up 70% and 30% of the container's width, respectively.

Media queries are used to adjust the layout for smaller screens:

- At screen widths of 768px or less, both the `.main-content` and `.sidebar` take up 100% width and are no longer floated, stacking them vertically.
- At screen widths of 480px or less, the `.container` width is increased to 95% to give more space to the content on very small screens, and the `.header` and `.footer` text is centered for better aesthetics on mobile devices.

### Reasoning:

The approach taken here is to start with a mobile-first perspective, where you style the page for the smallest screens first and then use media queries to progressively enhance the layout for larger screens. This is a common and recommended approach for responsive design because it ensures that your site is usable on the smallest devices from the start. The use of percentages for widths allows the layout to adapt to various screen sizes, and the media queries provide breakpoints where the layout can change to better suit the available screen real estate.
