To write end-to-end tests for an e-commerce website, we would typically use a testing framework like Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, or a similar tool that allows us to simulate user interactions with a web browser. Since I cannot run actual code here, I will provide you with a high-level example of what such tests might look like using pseudo-code. The tests will cover the following scenarios:

1. Home Page Load
2. Search for a Product
3. Add a Product to the Cart
4. Checkout Process

Here is the pseudo-code for the end-to-end tests:


### Summary
The pseudo-code above outlines the basic steps for end-to-end tests on an e-commerce website. These tests simulate a user's journey from landing on the home page to completing a purchase. The tests ensure that the critical functionalities like searching for products, adding them to the cart, and the checkout process are working as expected.

### Output JSON Checklist

### Reasoning for Approach
The approach taken here is to simulate a typical user flow on an e-commerce website, ensuring that the main features work as intended. Each test is designed to mimic user actions and verify that the website responds correctly. The JSON checklist provides a structured way to track the tests and their purposes. This approach helps in identifying any critical issues that could affect the user experience and overall functionality of the website.
